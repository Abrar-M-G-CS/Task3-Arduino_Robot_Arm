# Task3-Arduino_Robot_Arm


In this Task we are supposed to program the Arduino_Robot_Arm using the Arduino IDE however i have faced some errors that 
i have included in the ouput file and will explain it but before that i want to explain the steps to get the Arduino IDE 

Step 1 : before having the IDE you need to make sure that the robot arm is fully running in the Rviz environment , so we can adjest the robot arm from the Arduino 

Step 2 : downloading the IDE , i have downloaded the Arduino IDE version 1.8.13 because i have ubuntu version 16.4 becasue it the only version that have worked with me i have tried 18.4 and 20.4 but faild to run the ROS operating system, i will put the link to where you can download the Arduino IDE and you can choose the release that is compatible with you system

Step 3 : after instlling the IDE after watching a youtube video that explains the steps i managed to launch the IDE 

Step 4: setting the ROS library in the Arduino IDE, in this step i had the most problems and as you can see in the output pictures i had an error in the Cmake and couldn't solve it but i think the problem is duo to the release of the software



I also would link the Configuration repastoriy that i have used
